<h1>Business Process Reengineering and ERP Implementation</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a simple PowerShell script that walks the user through "zeroing out" (wiping) any drives that are connected to the system. The utility allows you to select the target disk and choose the number of passes that are performed. The PowerShell script will configure a diskpart script file based on the user's selections and then launch Diskpart to perform the disk sanitization.

<h1>Spritzer ERP Implementation (Sage X3)</h1>

### [View Project Report (PDF)](docs/ERP_Report.pdf)

<h2>Description</h2>

This project showcases the full implementation of an **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)** system for **Spritzer Berhad**, Malaysia’s leading natural mineral water brand.  
The implementation uses **Sage X3** to integrate Procurement, Sales, Inventory, and Finance under one unified digital system — improving efficiency, accuracy, and data-driven decision-making.

Spritzer previously faced issues such as:
- Inventory inaccuracies and manual counting errors  
- Ineffective demand forecasting during seasonal spikes  
- Disconnected systems (ERP, WMS, MES) creating data silos  

After the ERP deployment, all business processes were reengineered into a seamless, real-time system.

<br />

<h2>Languages and Tools Used</h2>

- <b>Sage X3</b> (ERP Platform)  
- <b>Power BI</b> (Dashboard & Analytics)  
- <b>Microsoft Excel</b> (Data Preparation)  

<br />

<h2>Environments Used</h2>

- <b>Windows 11</b>  
- <b>Power BI Service</b>  
- <b>Sage X3 Cloud Environment</b>

<br />

<h2>ERP Implementation Overview</h2>

1. **Planning & Gap Analysis** – Identified inefficiencies in legacy systems.  
2. **Reconfiguration & Data Migration** – Master data setup for suppliers, customers, and inventory.  
3. **Customization** – Configured P2P, O2C, and Financial modules.  
4. **Testing & User Training** – Simulated workflows and trained team members.  
5. **Go-Live & Optimization** – Deployed live Sage X3 instance and dashboards.

<h2>Core Business Modules</h2>

<h3>🔹 Purchase-to-Pay (P2P)</h3>

Automated procurement from Purchase Request (PR) to Payment (PIN), reducing human errors and approval delays.
